            <li>Place tomato and chiles with salt, 1 clove garlic, oregano, and cumin in a blender; add 2 cups water. Blend until smooth. Strain mixture through a fine-mesh sieve and set chile sauce aside.</li>
            <li>Transfer pork to a work surface and shred with 2 forks. Discard pork bones and garlic.</li>
            <li>Stir chile sauce and shredded pork into the pot. Simmer pozole until flavors have blended, about 5 minutes.</li>
